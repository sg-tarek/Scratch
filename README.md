# Scratch

As part of by Computer Science course at Harvard University (CS50) I was assigned a task to work with pseudocode to create a simple game. The code is based on scratch which is a block-based visual programming language and website created by MIT and targeted primarily at children 8-16 to help learn code.

My program is a simple math quiz for kids, which starts from 2*1 and ends at 10*10. The translation package is included so you can pick your own language for the sprites. The default language is danish.

My program can be found and adjusted here (or you can donwloade the program above): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/469198038/
