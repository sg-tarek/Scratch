# Scratch

As part of by Computer Science course at Harvard University (CS50) I was assigned a task to work with pseudocode to create a simple game. The code is based on scratch which is a block-based visual programming language and website targeted primarily at children 8-16 to help learn code.

My program can be found and adjusted here (or you can donwloade the program above): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/469198038/
