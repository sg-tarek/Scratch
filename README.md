# Scratch

As part of by Computer Science course at Harvard University (CS50) I was assigned a task to work with pseudocode to create a simple game. The code is based on scratch which is a block-based visual programming language and website created by MIT and targeted primarily at children 8-16 to help learn code.

My program is a simple math quiz for kids, which starts from 2 * 1 and ends at 10 * 10. The translation package is included so you can pick your own language for the sprites. The default language is danish.

My program can be found and adjusted here (or you can donwloade the program above): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/469198038/

## Proposed Enhancement: Hard Mode

To encourage higher-level thinking and problem-solving, a "Hard Mode" has been added to the project. This mode presents double-digit multiplication problems (e.g., 34 × 27) for students who have mastered the basic multiplication table.

### How to Use
- Open the project in Scratch.
- Look for the "Hard Mode" button on the stage.
- Click the button to switch to challenging two-digit multiplication problems.
- The game will adapt the scoring and feedback accordingly.

This enhancement aims to provide a progressive learning path and keep advanced students engaged while reinforcing multi-digit multiplication skills.
